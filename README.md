This application is a work in progress. The code is not the cleanest, as I am learning React after having used Angular professionally for the past year. I've already noticed a number of 'code smells' that I intend on fixing (eventually).

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I know nothing about electron packaging, so that's definitely an area where I may need help.
